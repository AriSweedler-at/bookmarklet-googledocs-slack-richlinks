## Customization

### Change the bookmarklet name
```bash
export BOOKMARKLET_NAME="ðŸ“„ My Custom Name"
cat gdocs-slack.js | ./js-to-bookmarklet.sh

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm (required for minification with terser)

## Troubleshooting

- **"This only works on Google Docs"**: Make sure you're on `docs.google.com/document/...`
- **"Copy failed"**: Try refreshing the page, fallback copies plain text
- **Browser compatibility**: Works best in Chrome/Edge, may fall back to plain text in Firefox
- **"npm is required"**: Install Node.js to get npm and npx
