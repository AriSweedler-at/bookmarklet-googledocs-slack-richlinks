# Bookmarklet Compiler & RichLinker

A modular system for creating JavaScript bookmarklets with shared libraries. Includes RichLinker - a multi-platform rich link generator that works across Google Docs, Atlassian Confluence, and Airtable with smart duplicate detection.

## Quick Start

```bash
bin/js-to-bookmarklet richlinker
```

## Project Structure

```
📁 src/                           # Source code directory
  ├── bookmarklet/                # Individual bookmarklet files
  │   ├── richlinker.js          # Multi-platform rich link generator
  │   └── ...                    # Additional bookmarklets
  └── js-lib/                    # Shared libraries (auto-included)
      ├── notifications.js       # Notification system with debug mode
      └── clipboard.js           # Modern clipboard utilities

📁 bin/                          # Executable scripts
  └── js-to-bookmarklet          # Bookmarklet compiler

🔧 .recent-bookmarklet           # Tracks most recently compiled file
```

1. Chrome opens with installation page
2. Drag the button to your bookmarks bar
3. Go to any supported site (Google Docs, Atlassian, Airtable) and click your bookmark
4. Paste anywhere and you get a rich formatted link!

## Customization

### Environment Variables
Customize the compiler behavior with these environment variables:

```bash
# Custom emoji for bookmarklet names
JS2BM_EMOJI="🔗" bin/js-to-bookmarklet src/bookmarklet/richlinker

# Default usage (requires `fzf`)
bin/js-to-bookmarklet
```

### Edit the JavaScript
Modify files in `src/bookmarklet/` to change behavior, then regenerate with the command above.

Notice the `//ARI_include` directives, those add library files like
`notifications.js`, which is really handy

You can create any bookmarklet with `bin/js-to-bookmarklet`

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm (required for minification with terser)

### Build Pipeline
The shell script provides a complete build and installation pipeline:
- **Minification**: Optimizes JavaScript for bookmarklet size limits
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Browser Detection**: Auto-opens Chrome/Chromium for installation
- **Size Warnings**: Alerts if bookmarklet exceeds browser limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"No handler found for this page"**: Make sure you're on a supported site (Google Docs, Atlassian Confluence, Airtable task pages)
- **"Copy failed"**: Try refreshing the page, check browser clipboard permissions
- **"Focus required"**: Click inside the document first, then try the bookmarklet

### github-autoscroll

This only makes sense for refactoring changes where the changes are within 1
screen-length and very repetitive. Lmao. Anyway.
